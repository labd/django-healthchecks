2.0.0 (unreleased)
==================
 - This version now only supports Python 3.6+ and Django 2.2+
 - Implemented heartbeat support. With this healthcheck you can write add
   'last active' flag to the database which is then used by a healthcheck
   endpoint to see if it was updated recently. This is for example really
   useful for background tasks (e.g. celery)
 - Allow passing in the a custom status code for errors via an HTTP header, by
   default 'X-HEALTHCHECK-ERROR-CODE'. This is helpful for kubernetes
   healthchecks which can only act on http status codes.
